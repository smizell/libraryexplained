          The current Calloway County Public Library (CCPL) building is
          underserving the residents of Calloway County in ways that an
          expansion would alleviate. Public support for the library has not
          wavered, though. Program attendance has seen a
          <strong>20% increase</strong> since 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following timeline was created to show when the expansion planning
          started, and what progress has been made in order to give the
          residents of Calloway County the library they deserve. It will be
          updated to reflect any new developments.

          <p>
            In July of 1969 land was purchased at 710 Main Street for the site
            of the new library. The work began and the library was completed in
            1970. Renovations of the library started in 1975 to add office
            space, a 150 seat meeting room, a foyer, and a larger parking lot.
          </p>
          <strong>
            The work was completed in 1976 and the library has not been
            renovated or expanded since
          </strong>.

            The board acknowledges the need for an expansion and creates a
            building fund. In 2011 the library purchased adjacent property
            on Olive Street from the county for $1 to be used in an expansion.
            By 2018 the initial building fund of $14,000
            <strong>will grow to over 3 million dollars</strong>.

          <p>
            <a href="http://www.callowaycountylibrary.org/Strategic-Plan.html">CCPL completed its first
              strategic plan
              in 2011</a>. Out of that process came five initiatives or areas the
            library should work on:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-square">
            <li>Educate the public about the library</li>
            <li>Drive an organizational culture that excels in customer service</li>
            <li>Define and implement a long-term user-focused facility plan</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.callowaycountylibrary.org/Services.html">Improve and expand programs, materials,
                and services</a></li>
            <li>Establish framework for self-assessment and identification of best practices.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In 2013 the library updated the plan to include newly
            developed core values, a vision statement, an updated mission
            statement, and five key strategies. During a 2014 a Facility
            Planning Meeting the library formed three commitees to assess
            Internal Needs, External Best Practices and Financial Feasibility.
            These three committees were comprised of board members, staff and
            community stakeholders.

        <div class="time-frame-desc lh-copy f4 black-80">
          <p>
            The three committees presented their findings to the board, and it
            was agreed that the library needed to move forward in planning an
            expansion. In December 2015 four architects were invited to
            present an assessment and vision for the current library facility.

          <p>
            In October 2016, the public was invited to review and discuss two
            options drafted by Louisville-based 5253 Design Group. Ultimately,
            the board decided on a compromise of the two options called the
            "Essential Plus" plan: a 28,000 sq. ft. facility coming in at a
            completed project cost of $6.4M.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some have argued that this expansion would increase the taxes
            collected on behalf of the library; however, in September 2016 the
            board voted to <b>reduce</b> the tax rate from .064 cents to .059
            cents per $100 of assessed property value. Calloway County has one
            of the lowest special taxing district tax rates in the state of
            Kentucky.
